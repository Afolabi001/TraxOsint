# /**Probabilities**\
#
# - fully async (asynchrone)
#
# Explanation:
#   - If an api says that the place is New York and the other 2 say the same, the city will be displayed with "++" (very likely).
#   - When an api gives a city, this is noted and is compared with the other results to deduce the probabilities with "+" or "-".
#

#                  | -  | Not very likely |
